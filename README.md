# K-Means Clusters #

An implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm in C#.
Core code is a product of me reading "Machine Learning Using C# Succinctly" by James McCaffrey. This book can be found free of charge at https://www.syncfusion.com/.
Additional improvements and modifications are my own.
